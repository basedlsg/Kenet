# Committee Charter: The Code Guardians (Best Practices & Code Quality)

## Mandate
To define and enforce the project's software engineering standards, ensuring all code is maintainable, efficient, and thoroughly tested.

## Phase 1 Directives

### 1. Initial Key Questions (Due: EOD 2025-08-13)
Your first task is to produce a Research & Design Document (RDD) that provides definitive answers to the following questions:

*   **1.1: Profiling and Observability Framework:** What profiling tools should be integrated into the main loop to measure the latency of each SLAM stage? Your RDD must include:
    *   A comparison of at least two profiling libraries (e.g., `cProfile`, `Py-spy`).
    *   A detailed plan for integrating the chosen profiler into the existing codebase.
    *   A proposal for a standardized logging format for performance metrics.

*   **1.2: CI/CD Workflow:** What is the optimal CI/CD workflow for a project involving both Python code and ML model training? Your RDD should include:
    *   A recommended CI/CD platform (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
    *   A detailed pipeline design that includes linting, unit testing, integration testing, and performance benchmarking.
    *   A strategy for managing and versioning ML models and datasets.

### 2. Collaboration Protocol
*   You are required to hold a kickoff meeting with all other committees to communicate the project's engineering standards and to understand their CI/CD and profiling needs.

All findings and recommendations must be submitted as a formal RDD to the Oversight Committee for review.
