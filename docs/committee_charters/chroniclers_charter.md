# Committee Charter: The Chroniclers (Documentation & Knowledge Management)

## Mandate
To ensure all project knowledge is captured, organized, and easily accessible.

## Phase 1 Directives

### 1. Initial Key Questions (Due: EOD 2025-08-13)
Your first task is to produce a Research & Design Document (RDD) that provides definitive answers to the following questions:

*   **1.1: Documentation Platform:** What is the best platform for hosting the project's official documentation? Your analysis must include:
    *   A comparison of at least two platforms (e.g., Read the Docs, Confluence, a custom-built site).
    *   A recommendation for the best platform for our needs, including a cost-benefit analysis.

*   **1.2: Documentation Standards:** What are the documentation standards that all committees must follow? Your RDD should include:
    *   A template for Research & Design Documents (RDDs).
    *   A template for Technical Design Documents (TDDs).
    *   A style guide for all written documentation.

### 2. Collaboration Protocol
*   You are required to hold a kickoff meeting with all other committees to communicate the documentation standards and to understand their documentation needs.

All findings and recommendations must be submitted as a formal RDD to the Oversight Committee for review.
