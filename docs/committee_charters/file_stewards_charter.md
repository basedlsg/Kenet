# Committee Charter: The File Stewards (File Structure & Organization)

## Mandate
To establish and maintain a clean, logical, and well-documented file structure for the entire project, ensuring that all project artifacts are easy to find, understand, and use.

## Responsibilities
1.  **Design and Document:** Create and document a comprehensive file and folder structure for the project.
2.  **Enforce Standards:** Ensure all new and existing files adhere to the established organizational standards.
3.  **Conduct Audits:** Periodically review the file system to identify and correct any deviations from the standard.
4.  **Manage Migrations:** Oversee the migration of existing files into the new, standardized structure.
5.  **Integrate with Other Committees:** Collaborate with other committees to ensure the file structure meets their needs and that they understand their role in maintaining it.

## Phase 1 Directives

### 1. Initial Key Questions (Due: EOD 2025-08-13)
Your first task is to produce a Research & Design Document (RDD) that provides definitive answers to the following questions:

*   **1.1: File and Folder Structure:** What is the optimal file and folder structure for the project? Your RDD must include:
    *   A clearly defined hierarchy for all project artifacts, including code, documentation, data, and reports.
    *   A naming convention for files and folders.
    *   A plan for managing and versioning datasets and other large files.

*   **1.2: Auditing and Enforcement:** How will the file structure standards be enforced? Your RDD should include:
    *   A process for periodically auditing the file system.
    *   A plan for correcting deviations from the standard.
    *   A proposal for tools or scripts to automate the enforcement of standards.

### 2. Collaboration Protocol
*   You are required to hold a kickoff meeting with all other committees to communicate the proposed file structure and to gather feedback on their specific needs.

All findings and recommendations must be submitted as a formal RDD to the Oversight Committee for review.
