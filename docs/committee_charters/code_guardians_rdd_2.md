# RDD-CG-002: CI/CD Workflow

## 1.0 Introduction
This document addresses the second key question for the Code Guardians: "What is the optimal CI/CD workflow for a project involving both Python code and ML model training?"

## 2.0 Analysis of the Options
We have identified three main options for our CI/CD platform:

*   **GitHub Actions:** A CI/CD platform that is tightly integrated with GitHub.
*   **Jenkins:** A popular open-source CI/CD platform that is highly extensible.
*   **CircleCI:** A cloud-based CI/CD platform that is known for its speed and performance.

## 3.0 Recommendation
We recommend that we use **GitHub Actions** for our project. It is the easiest to use of the three options, and its tight integration with GitHub will be a major advantage for our team.

## 4.0 Next Steps
*   The Code Guardians will now proceed to the next phase of the project, which is to design and implement the CI/CD pipeline.
