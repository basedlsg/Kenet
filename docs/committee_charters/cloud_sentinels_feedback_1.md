# Feedback on Cloud Sentinels RDDs

## RDD-CS-001: Managed vs. Self-Hosted Vector DB
*   **Assessment:** Approved. The recommendation to use Qdrant Cloud is a good one.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   The Cloud Sentinels are now directed to create a Qdrant Cloud account and to provide the necessary credentials to the Indexing Core.

## RDD-CS-002: Fine-Tuning for Verification
*   **Assessment:** Approved. The recommendation to proceed with a proof-of-concept to fine-tune a smaller model on Vertex AI is a good one.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   The Cloud Sentinels should work with the Pathfinder Guild to select a candidate model for fine-tuning.
    *   The Cloud Sentinels should then create a proof-of-concept to fine-tune the model on Vertex AI.
