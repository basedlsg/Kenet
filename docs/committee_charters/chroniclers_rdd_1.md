# RDD-CH-001: Documentation Platform

## 1.0 Introduction
This document addresses the first key question for the Chroniclers: "What is the best platform for hosting the project's official documentation?"

## 2.0 Analysis of the Options
We have identified three main options for our documentation platform:

*   **Read the Docs:** A popular open-source platform that is specifically designed for technical documentation.
*   **Confluence:** A commercial platform that is popular with enterprise teams.
*   **GitBook:** A modern documentation platform that is designed to be easy to use.

## 3.0 Recommendation
We recommend that we use **Read the Docs** for our project. It is the most cost-effective option, and it is well-suited for technical documentation.

## 4.0 Next Steps
*   The Chroniclers will now proceed to the second key question: "What are the documentation standards that all committees must follow?"
