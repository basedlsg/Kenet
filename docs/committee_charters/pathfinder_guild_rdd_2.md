# RDD-PG-002: Geometric Pruning Libraries

## 1.0 Introduction
This document addresses the second key question for the Pathfinder Guild: "Can we identify any open-source `gtsam` integration libraries or geometric verification modules that meet our quality standards?"

## 2.0 Analysis of the Bottleneck
The current implementation simulates a geometric check, which means that the expensive LLM verification is performed on candidates that are not physically close. This is a major performance bottleneck.

## 3.0 Proposed Solution
Based on a web search, we have identified a promising open-source library called `gtsam-geometry`. This library appears to provide a collection of geometric utilities and data structures that are compatible with `gtsam`.

## 4.0 Recommendations
Without being able to browse the repository, we cannot definitively assess its quality. Therefore, we recommend that the **Best Practices & Code Quality Committee** conduct a thorough review of the `gtsam-geometry` repository as their next task. This review should include:

*   A code quality assessment.
*   A review of the documentation.
*   An analysis of the license.
*   A performance evaluation.

Based on their findings, we can then make a final decision on whether to adopt this library or build a custom solution.

## 5.0 Next Steps
*   The Best Practices & Code Quality Committee should begin their review of the `gtsam-geometry` repository immediately.
*   The Pathfinder Guild will await their findings before making a final recommendation.
