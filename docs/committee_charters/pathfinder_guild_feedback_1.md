# Feedback on Pathfinder Guild RDDs

## RDD-PG-001: Alternative Verification Models
*   **Assessment:** Approved. The two-pronged approach of prototyping a lightweight CNN in the short-term and investigating adapter-based fine-tuning in the long-term is a sound strategy.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   The RAG & Vector Systems Committee is now authorized to begin prototyping the MobileNetV2 solution.
    *   The Pathfinder Guild should continue to research the adapter-based approach and provide a more detailed report in the next phase.

## RDD-PG-002: Geometric Pruning Libraries
*   **Assessment:** Approved. The recommendation to have the Best Practices & Code Quality Committee review the `gtsam-geometry` repository is a good one.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   The Best Practices & Code Quality Committee is now directed to conduct a thorough review of the `gtsam-geometry` repository.
    *   The Pathfinder Guild should await their findings before making a final recommendation.
