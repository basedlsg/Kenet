# RDD-PA-001: Automated Authentication MCP

## 1.0 Introduction
This document addresses the first key question for the Protocol Architects: "Can an MCP be created to abstract away the `gcloud auth` process, handling token refreshes automatically?"

## 2.0 Analysis of the Options
We have identified two main options for authenticating with Google Cloud:

*   **`gcloud auth`:** A command-line tool that is intended for interactive use.
*   **Service Accounts:** A special type of Google account that is intended for programmatic use.

## 3.0 Recommendation
We recommend that we create an MCP server that uses the `google-auth` library to authenticate with a service account. This will allow us to abstract away the `gcloud auth` process and to handle token refreshes automatically.

## 4.0 Next Steps
*   The Protocol Architects will now proceed to the second key question: "What would an MCP for running a full SLAM experiment and returning a performance report look like?"
