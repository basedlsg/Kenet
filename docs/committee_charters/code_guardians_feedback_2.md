# Feedback on Best Practices & Code Quality Committee RDD

## RDD-BPCQ-2: A New File Modification Protocol
*   **Assessment:** Approved. The recommendation to create a new, two-tiered file modification protocol is an excellent one. The new `safe_apply_diff` and `safe_write_to_file` tools are well-designed and will eliminate the state drift errors that have been plaguing the project.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   The Best Practices & Code Quality Committee is now directed to proceed with Phase 3: Implementation & Integration. You are to integrate the new tools into the development environment and to deprecate the old `apply_diff` and `write_to_file` tools.
