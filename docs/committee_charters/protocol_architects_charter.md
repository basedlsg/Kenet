# Committee Charter: The Protocol Architects (MCP Integration)

## Mandate
To identify, design, and implement Model Context Protocols that enhance the development workflow, automate complex tasks, and improve the capabilities of the AI agent managing the project.

## Phase 1 Directives

### 1. Initial Key Questions (Due: EOD 2025-08-13)
Your first task is to produce a Research & Design Document (RDD) that provides definitive answers to the following questions:

*   **1.1: Automated Authentication MCP:** Can an MCP be created to abstract away the `gcloud auth` process, handling token refreshes automatically? Your RDD must include:
    *   A technical design for the MCP server, including the tools it would provide.
    *   An analysis of the security implications and a proposed solution for securely storing and managing credentials.
    *   A prototype implementation of the MCP server.

*   **1.2: SLAM Experimentation MCP:** What would an MCP for running a full SLAM experiment and returning a performance report look like? Your RDD should include:
    *   A detailed design for the MCP server and the tools it would provide (e.g., `run_experiment`, `get_results`).
    *   A definition of the data structures used for experiment configuration and results.
    *   A prototype implementation of the MCP server.

### 2. Collaboration Protocol
*   You are required to hold a kickoff meeting with the **Best Practices Guardians** to ensure your MCP servers are compliant with the project's security and infrastructure standards.
*   You must consult with the **Cloud Sentinels** to understand how to securely manage Google Cloud credentials.

All findings and recommendations must be submitted as a formal RDD to the Oversight Committee for review.
