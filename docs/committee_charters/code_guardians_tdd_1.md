# TDD-CG-001: Safe File Modification Tools

## 1.0 Introduction
*   **1.1: Overview:** This document outlines the technical design for the `safe_apply_diff` and `safe_write_to_file` tools. These tools will replace the existing, error-prone `apply_diff` and `write_to_file` tools.
*   **1.2: Requirements:**
    *   The tools must be robust and reliable, and must not be susceptible to state drift errors.
    *   The tools must be easy to use and well-documented.

## 2.0 Design
*   **2.1: `safe_apply_diff`:**
    *   **Architecture:** This tool will be a Python script that takes two arguments: the path to the file to be modified, and the diff to be applied.
    *   **Components:**
        *   A function to read the file from disk.
        *   A function to apply the diff using the `python-patch` library.
        *   A function to write the modified file to disk.
    *   **Data Model:** The diff will be a string in the unified diff format.
*   **2.2: `safe_write_to_file`:**
    *   **Architecture:** This tool will be a Python script that takes two arguments: the path to the file to be written, and the content to be written.
    *   **Components:**
        *   A function to create a backup of the original file.
        *   A function to write the new content to the file.
        *   A function to restore the backup if the write operation fails.
    *   **Data Model:** The content will be a string.

## 3.0 Implementation
*   **3.1: Implementation Plan:**
    *   The tools will be implemented as Python scripts in the `tools` directory.
    *   The tools will be documented in the `docs/tools` directory.
*   **3.2: Testing Plan:**
    *   The tools will be tested against a suite of file modification scenarios, including:
        *   Applying a valid diff to a file.
        *   Applying an invalid diff to a file.
        *   Writing a new file.
        *   Overwriting an existing file.
        *   A failed write operation.

## 4.0 Next Steps
*   **4.1: Action Items:**
    *   The Code Guardians will now proceed to the next step, which is to develop a prototype of the new tools.
