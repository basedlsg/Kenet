# Error Log and Resolutions

This document provides a summary of the errors encountered during the development and testing of the benchmarking script, along with their resolutions. This is intended to help new developers get up to speed on the project and avoid common pitfalls.

## 1. Environment-Specific Command Errors

### 1.1 `touch` command not recognized

*   **Context:** When initially setting up the project, I attempted to create the `requirements.txt` file using the `touch` command, which is common in Linux/macOS environments.
*   **Error:** The command failed because `touch` is not a recognized command in the Windows environment.
*   **Resolution:** I switched to using the `write_to_file` tool to create the `requirements.txt` file, which is a more platform-agnostic approach.

### 1.2 `pip` command not found

*   **Context:** When trying to install the project dependencies, the `pip install` command failed.
*   **Error:** The `pip` executable was not found in the system's PATH.
*   **Resolution:** I used the `python -m pip install` command instead. This is the recommended way to run `pip` in modern Python environments and is more robust as it directly uses the Python interpreter to run the `pip` module.

## 2. File Path Errors

### 2.1 `FileNotFoundError`

*   **Context:** The `train_mobilenet.py` script was unable to find the dummy images.
*   **Error:** The script was looking for the images in the root directory of the project, but they were located in the `prototypes` directory.
*   **Resolution:** I corrected the file paths in the `train_mobilenet.py` script to point to the correct location of the images (e.g., `prototypes/image1.jpg`).

## 3. Google Generative AI API Errors

### 3.1 `InvalidArgument: 400 embedContent only supports 'text' content`

*   **Context:** When benchmarking the `gemini-1.5-flash` model, I initially tried to pass the image data directly to the `embed_content` function.
*   **Error:** The API returned an error indicating that the `embed_content` function only accepts text as input.
*   **Resolution:** I updated the script to first generate descriptive captions for the images using the `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` model. The generated captions were then passed to the `embed_content` function to get the embeddings.

### 3.2 `AttributeError: module 'google.generativeai' has no attribute 'generate_text'`

*   **Context:** When implementing the caption generation logic, I used an incorrect function name.
*   **Error:** The `google.generativeai` module does not have a `generate_text` function.
*   **Resolution:** I corrected the code to use the `GenerativeModel` class and the `generate_content` method, which is the correct way to generate text with the Gemini API.

### 3.3 `ValueError: shapes not aligned`

*   **Context:** After successfully generating embeddings for the image captions, the script failed when calculating the cosine similarity.
*   **Error:** The `ValueError` indicated that the shapes of the two arrays being used in the dot product were not aligned. This was because the `embed_content` function returns a list of embeddings, and I was not correctly unpacking the two embeddings from the list before performing the calculation.
*   **Resolution:** I corrected the code to unpack the two embeddings from the list into separate numpy arrays before calculating the cosine similarity. This ensures that the dot product is performed on two vectors of the same shape.
