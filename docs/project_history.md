# A History of Project Atropos

This document chronicles the key milestones, challenges, and accomplishments of Project Atropos, from its inception as a sophisticated robotics navigation system to its current strategic realignment.

## Project Inception: LLM-Guided Semantic SLAM

The project began as an ambitious effort to address the brittleness of traditional SLAM systems. The core idea, detailed in the `final_paper_v3.md`, was to create a novel **LLM-guided Semantic SLAM framework**. This system integrates a Vision-Language Model (VLM) into the SLAM loop to leverage high-level scene understanding, overcoming the limitations of purely geometric approaches.

The initial implementation was a fully simulated, end-to-end system for training and evaluating an AI-controlled SLAM solution. It successfully integrated a classical `gtsam` factor graph with a modern RAG pipeline for semantic loop closure, all managed by a PPO reinforcement learning agent.

## Key Milestones

*   **Development of RAG-Based Loop Closure:** The project's first major achievement was the creation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for semantic loop closure. This system uses a Qdrant vector database and Gemini embeddings to create a semantic scene memory, enabling robust loop closure based on contextual understanding.
*   **Physics-Aware Pre-training:** To ground the VLM's understanding in physical reality, the team developed **MetaSpatial Pre-training**. This novel methodology instills a sense of "layout sanity" into the model, drastically reducing the Impossible Constraint Rate (ICR) from 75% to 0% in ablation studies.
*   **Reinforcement Learning for Control:** A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, implemented with Ray RLlib, was developed to serve as the high-level controller. This agent dynamically adapts the SLAM system's parameters to balance computational load with mapping accuracy.
*   **Strategic Realignment:** The project underwent a significant strategic realignment, detailed in `PROJECT_ATROPOS_MASTER_PLAN.md`. This introduced a new committee-based structure to transform the proof-of-concept into a robust, scalable, and production-grade robotics intelligence platform.

## Challenges and Resolutions

*   **Performance Bottlenecks:** The `slam_analysis_summary.md` identified significant performance bottlenecks in the initial implementation. The primary issues were the slow, sequential population of the vector database and the real-time verification of loop closure candidates using expensive LLM calls.
    *   **Resolution:** The proposed solution was to implement a **multi-stage verification funnel**. This involved batching and parallelizing the offline indexing and introducing a geometric pruning filter to reduce the number of candidates requiring LLM verification.
*   **Model Benchmarking Errors:** The `onboarding_analysis.md` details a persistent `ValueError` encountered while benchmarking loop closure verification models. The error stemmed from an incorrect attempt to calculate the dot product of a list of embeddings instead of the individual embeddings themselves.
    *   **Resolution:** In accordance with the "Pivot Protocol," the team created an isolated test script (`test_gemini.py`) to debug the embedding and similarity calculation logic before applying the fix to the main benchmarking script.

## Current Status and Future Goals

As of August 2025, Project Atropos is in **Phase 1: Foundation & Deep Research**. The project is now governed by a set of committees, each with a specific mandate, working in parallel to achieve the project's goals.

The immediate goals are for each committee to answer its "Initial Key Questions" and deliver foundational components, including:
*   A full CI/CD pipeline and profiling framework.
*   A cost analysis of the current pipeline and a proposal for using Vertex AI.
*   An RDD for a multi-stage verification funnel and batch indexing.

The long-term vision is to implement the core optimizations designed in Phase 1, followed by the development of advanced features like hybrid descriptors and curriculum training for the PPO agent.
