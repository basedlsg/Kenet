# Next Step Proposal for Project Atropos

**Date:** 2025-08-07

## 1. Proposed Next Step

With the successful completion of "Phase 1: Foundation & Deep Research," the next strategic priority for Project Atropos is to commence **"Phase 2: Implementation of Core Optimizations."**

The immediate development task is for the **Indexing Core committee to implement batch indexing and a geometric pruning filter.**

## 2. Rationale

This task is the critical first step in Phase 2 and directly addresses the primary performance bottlenecks identified during the research phase. The rationale for this prioritization is as follows:

*   **Addresses Core Performance Bottlenecks:** The current system's performance is limited by its inefficient, single-item indexing and lack of a sophisticated candidate filtering mechanism. Implementing batch indexing and geometric pruning will yield the most significant improvements in throughput and accuracy, as outlined in the Phase 2 goals of the Master Plan.
*   **Unlocks Future Development:** The completion of this task is a prerequisite for the "Advanced Features & RL Tuning" phase. A performant and stable indexing and retrieval system is foundational for developing more advanced capabilities like hybrid descriptors and reinforcement learning-based control.
*   **Data-Driven Decision:** The need for these optimizations was a key finding from the research and prototyping work completed in Phase 1. Proceeding with this task ensures we are acting on the empirical evidence gathered, in line with the project's principle of "Empirical Rigor."

By focusing on the Indexing Core's primary task, we tackle the most impactful engineering challenge first, ensuring that subsequent optimizations and features are built upon a robust and efficient foundation.
