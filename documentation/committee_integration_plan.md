# Committee Integration Plan: File Stewards

This document outlines the formal collaboration and communication protocols between the "File Stewards" and other project committees.

## 1. Integration with the Code Guardians

**Responsibilities of the File Stewards:**

*   Define and maintain a clear directory structure for all source code, including libraries, modules, and feature-specific code.
*   Provide a standardized process for requesting new directories or making changes to the existing code structure.
*   Collaborate with the Code Guardians to ensure that the file structure aligns with the project's CI/CD pipeline and testing strategies.

**Collaboration Protocol:**

*   **Requesting Changes:** The Code Guardians can request changes to the code directory structure by submitting a formal proposal to the File Stewards. The proposal must include a clear justification for the change and an analysis of its impact on the existing codebase.
*   **Regular Syncs:** The File Stewards and the Code Guardians will hold bi-weekly sync meetings to discuss upcoming features, potential changes to the file structure, and any issues related to code organization.
*   **Emergency Requests:** For urgent matters, such as a critical bug fix that requires a new directory, the Code Guardians can submit an emergency request to the File Stewards, who will review and approve it within 24 hours.

## 2. Integration with the Chroniclers

**Responsibilities of the File Stewards:**

*   Establish a dedicated directory for all project documentation, with a clear and consistent structure for organizing different types of documents (e.g., RDDs, TDDs, meeting notes).
*   Work with the Chroniclers to define a standardized naming convention for all documentation files.
*   Ensure that the documentation directory is easily accessible to all project members and that it is included in regular backups.

**Collaboration Protocol:**

*   **Documentation Structure:** The File Stewards will consult with the Chroniclers to design the initial documentation directory structure. Any subsequent changes must be reviewed and approved by both committees.
*   **Content Management:** The Chroniclers are responsible for the content of the documentation, while the File Stewards are responsible for the organization and accessibility of the files.
*   **Quarterly Audits:** The File Stewards and the Chroniclers will conduct quarterly audits of the documentation directory to ensure that it remains well-organized and that all files are up-to-date.

## 3. Integration with the Cloud Sentinels

**Responsibilities of the File Stewards:**

*   Collaborate with the Cloud Sentinels to define a secure and efficient structure for storing and managing cloud-based resources, such as datasets, models, and service keys.
*   Ensure that the file structure for cloud resources is consistent with the overall project structure and that it complies with all security and access control policies.
*   Provide a process for requesting access to cloud-based resources and for tracking their usage.

**Collaboration Protocol:**

*   **Cloud Resource Management:** The File Stewards will work with the Cloud Sentinels to develop a unified strategy for managing both local and cloud-based files.
*   **Security Reviews:** All proposed changes to the file structure for cloud resources must be reviewed and approved by the Cloud Sentinels to ensure that they do not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
*   **Cost Optimization:** The File Stewards will consult with the Cloud Sentinels to ensure that the file structure for cloud resources is designed to minimize storage costs and data transfer fees.

## 4. Integration with the Indexing Core

**Responsibilities of the File Stewards:**

*   Define a clear and consistent structure for storing and managing the data used by the RAG and vector systems, including raw data, processed data, and vector indexes.
*   Work with the Indexing Core to develop a process for versioning and updating the vector indexes.
*   Ensure that the data used by the RAG and vector systems is stored in a way that is both efficient and secure.

**Collaboration Protocol:**

*   **Data Pipeline:** The File Stewards will collaborate with the Indexing Core to design a data pipeline that automates the process of collecting, processing, and indexing data for the RAG and vector systems.
*   **Performance Tuning:** The File Stewards will consult with the Indexing Core to ensure that the file structure for the RAG and vector systems is optimized for performance.
*   **Data Governance:** The File Stewards and the Indexing Core will jointly develop a data governance plan that defines the policies and procedures for managing the data used by the RAG and vector systems.

## 5. Integration with the Pathfinder Guild

**Responsibilities of the File Stewards:**

*   Provide a dedicated space for the Pathfinder Guild to store and manage their research findings, including papers, articles, and code samples.
*   Work with the Pathfinder Guild to develop a system for organizing and tagging research materials to make them easily discoverable.
*   Ensure that the research materials collected by the Pathfinder Guild are accessible to all project members.

**Collaboration Protocol:**

*   **Research Repository:** The File Stewards will create and maintain a research repository for the Pathfinder Guild.
*   **Knowledge Sharing:** The Pathfinder Guild will provide regular updates to the File Stewards on their latest research findings, and the File Stewards will work to integrate this knowledge into the project's main documentation.
*   **Tool Integration:** The File Stewards will consult with the Pathfinder Guild to ensure that the file structure is compatible with the tools and technologies they use for their research.

## 6. Integration with the Protocol Architects

**Responsibilities of the File Stewards:**

*   Collaborate with the Protocol Architects to define a structure for storing and managing the files related to MCPs, including design documents, source code, and test cases.
*   Ensure that the file structure for MCPs is consistent with the overall project structure and that it follows all best practices for software development.
*   Provide a process for deploying and managing MCPs.

**Collaboration Protocol:**

*   **MCP Development:** The File Stewards will work with the Protocol Architects to develop a streamlined process for developing and deploying MCPs.
*   **API Documentation:** The Protocol Architects will provide the File Stewards with clear and comprehensive documentation for each MCP, and the File Stewards will ensure that this documentation is integrated into the project's main documentation.
*   **Version Control:** The File Stewards and the Protocol Architects will jointly develop a strategy for versioning and managing MCPs.

## 7. Formal Process for Requesting Changes

All requests for changes to the file structure must be submitted to the File Stewards through the project's official issue tracking system. Each request must include the following information:

*   **A clear and concise description of the proposed change.**
*   **A justification for the change, including the problem it solves or the opportunity it creates.**
*   **An analysis of the potential impact of the change on other parts of the project.**
*   **A proposed implementation plan, including a timeline and a list of any required resources.**

The File Stewards will review all change requests within three business days and will provide a formal response, which may include a request for additional information, an approval of the request, or a rejection of the request with a clear explanation.

## 8. Communication Channels

The following communication channels will be used for inter-committee collaboration on organizational matters:

*   **Slack:** A dedicated Slack channel, `#file-stewards`, will be created for informal discussions and quick questions related to the file structure.
*   **GitHub:** All formal change requests and bug reports related to the file structure will be managed through GitHub Issues.
*   **Monthly All-Hands Meeting:** The File Stewards will provide an update on the state of the file system at the monthly all-hands meeting and will be available to answer any questions from other committees.
